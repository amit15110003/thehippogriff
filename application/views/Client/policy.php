We use both “session ID cookies or session cookies” and “persistent cookies.” We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate the Website. A session cookie expires when you close your browser. If you check “remember me on this computer” when logging in to the Website, We also sets a persistent cookie to store you username passwords, so you do not have to enter it more than once. The persistent cookie also enables us to track and target the interests of users to enhance the experience on the Website. The persistent cookie is removed when you uncheck the “remember my email address” check box. For avoidance of doubt it is clarified that some of our business partners (such as advertisers) use cookies on the Website. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by us only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

Whenever you change or access your account information, we offer the use of a secure server. Once your information is in our possession we adhere to strict security guidelines, protecting it against unauthorized access. For example, we use “_________” to ensure that all transfer of user data and transactions are encrypted and secured, as per SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) criteria etc.</p>
<p >However, it remains each user&#8217;s responsibility:</p>
<ol>
<li >
<p >to protect against unauthorized access to your use of the Website;</p>
