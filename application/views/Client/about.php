			<p style="padding-top: 25px;">Story:</p>
			<p style="padding-top: 15px;">“ Early 2015, I had the urge to start something of my own. Being and avid online shopper myself  I had a certain attraction the market present then, speaking with the context of India. The idea at this time was rudimental and borderline amateur. I had to hop from one website to another to find things I really liked, and even though that itself was inconvenient I was gradually made aware of a bigger gap. The content available at all these places were extremely basic, childish, repetitive and lacked intellect. I wondered why content and designs these days are dumbed down for the people and why they were produced and sold without any thought put into any of them.</p>
			<p style="padding-top: 15px;">At the same time I was filled with awe with the kind of artwork I was witnessing on social media by independent artists and illustrators. I knew right there that combining these two segments would fill the gap I was dying to come out of. The idea was to take a painting of a wall, a gallery exhibition, an illustrator artboard or a standard sketchbook and put it on everyday products. If a person wanted to wear a T-shirt, they should have an option of sporting an artwork made with hours of dedication and priceless grey matter that a talented artist somewhere across the globe has conjured skilfully. I wanted to help budding artists get as many eyes and pay them for their contribution to my venture. At the same time I wanted to offer a choice to the people to consume better content. Quoting Steve Jobs ,’Be a yardstick of quality. Some people aren’t used to an environment where excellence is expected’. I’m confident about where we are heading and even more thrilled about giving art lovers what they want. “</p>
